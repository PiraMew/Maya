# Colonization and diversification history of Madagascan palms with new phylogenomic evidence from the genus *Orania* (Arecaceae)


This repository contains all scripts and supplementary material generated during the preparation of my Master's thesis.

The file XXX contains the submitted .pdf version of this Master's thesis.

The supplementary materials to the Part B and Part C of the thesis can be found under [/supplementary_material](./supplementary_material).

The folders [/1_phylo_reconstruction](./1_phylo_reconstruction), [/2_phylo_dating](./2_phylo_dating), and [/3_biogeography](./3_biogeography) correspond to the "Part B" of the Master's thesis, which aimed to reconstruct a dated phylogeny of the POS clade and apply  ancestral range estimations to this phylogeny. Each folder contains a detailed description of the methods applied and how to run the scripts.

The script [/partc_tfsp_correlation.R](./partc_tfsp_correlation) corresponds to the "Part C" of the thesis, which aimed to test the Time-for-Speciation hypothesis in Madagascan palms.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
